# JS Control Structures Practice

This repository provides a collection of JavaScript programs which focus on different control structures such as if-else, if-else-if, switch-case, for-loop, while-loop, and functions. It aims to demonstrate how each control structure can be utilized in real world scenarios.

## Contents

The repository consists of the following branches, each branch covers a specific set of control structures:

1. `UC1_if-else-practice`: This branch provides practice problems on if-else control structure.

2. `UC2_if-else-if-practice`: This branch focuses on problems related to if-else-if control structure.

3. `UC3_switch-case-practice`: In this branch, you will find problems based on the switch-case control structure.

4. `UC4_for-loop-practice`: This branch deals with for-loop related practice problems.

5. `UC5_while-loop-practice`: Practice problems in this branch are based on the while-loop control structure.

6. `UC6_functions-practice`: This branch provides problems that aim to enhance your knowledge about JavaScript functions.

<!-- The `main` branch of the repository provides a general overview and information about the repository. -->
The `main` branch holds the cumulative code, representing a compilation of all merged changes (branches). It also serves as a showcase for all implemented control structures, including if-else, if-else-if, switch-case, for-loop, while-loop, and various functions.

## Running the Code

You can clone this repository to your local machine to run the examples. You will need Node.js installed on your system to run the JavaScript programs. After cloning the repository, navigate to the specific branch and run the program using Node.js. 

For example:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Shri10/JS-control-structures-practice.git
$ cd JS-control-structures-practice
$ node script.js
```
